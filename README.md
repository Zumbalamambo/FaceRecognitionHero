# Face Recognition Hero

This is a game where you will be shown a Emoji(actualluy memes) and you should show this emoji so computer recognize it within 3 seconds.

Your aim in the game is to show as many emojis as you can, just like in guitar hero or dance revolution games.

This is a **proof of the concept**. And I'm going to implement this game for Android device soon.

## How to execute

Download this repository. It already contains the pretrained neural net so you do not need to train it. But you need this libraries to be installed:

- keras
- tensorflow
- numpy
- opencv-python
- pygame

When you are ready, just run do `cd game; python3 main.py` and wait for game reads NN, configure camera and does some other stuff.

Bum! Play the game!
